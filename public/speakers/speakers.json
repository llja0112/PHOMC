","presentationTitle":"The Future of Primary Care in Population Health (& Vice-Versa): Insights from a Personal Journey","presentationSynopsis":"Since medical school, I always thought Family Medicine and Primary Care were intimately bound with Public and Population Health. This was because both disciplines were within the same department then, and it was named Community, Occupational and Family Medicine (COFM). The two disciplines had many commonalities: they were both anchored in the community (as opposed to being hospital-based), generalist in nature (as opposed to specialist care) and bio-psycho-social in approach (as opposed to biomedicine). Unsurprisingly, both disciplines professionalised (i.e. family, occupational and preventive medicine formed their own clinical specializations) and public health grew to encompass epidemiology, biostatistics, modelling, health services research and health economics (with these sub-areas progressively led by non-clinicians). This evolution was worldwide and Singapore was no exception: the Family Medicine part of COFM joined the NUH Department of Medicine and COFM was renamed Department of Epidemiology and Public Health (EPH) in 2009, and EPH became the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health (SSHSPH) in 2011. I witnessed these changes firsthand as a family physician who joined COFM in 2005 till now as a Professor in SSHSPH. Throughout these past almost 30 years, I have juggled being a family physician, community geriatrician (yes, I also went into community geriatrics and gerontology) and public health professional, in research, teaching and service. I \u201creturned to my Family Medicine roots\u201d in 2018 when I was seconded to MOH Office of Healthcare Transformation to be Clinical Director (and later Head as well) of the Future Primary Care (FPC) team there. I refreshed my relationships with my polyclinic and GP colleagues, built telemedicine in primary care and implemented Healthier SG which seeks to shift the centre of gravity of Singapore\u2019s healthcare towards primary and preventive care. In this lecture, I will share how, despite the divergence of primary care from public health, I never ceased to see these two disciplines as intimately bound, and why and how I foresee these two disciplines will remain intimately bound in the future."},{"index":10,"name":"Prof Benjamin Seet ","title":"Group Chairman Medical Board \nNational Healthcare Group","biography":"Ben Seet oversees research, innovation and academic partnership at the National Healthcare Group.

We evaluated genetic predispositions for body mass index (BMI) in 8,342 Singapore Chinese participants from the Singapore Chinese Health Study, who were followed up from measurement of BMI at midlife (average 53 years), to measurements of Timed Up-and-Go (TUG) test (as a functional mobility measure) 20 years later. A robust 75.83% of genetically determined BMI effects on TUG was mediated through midlife BMI (P = 9.24\u00d710-21). Utilizing Mendelian randomization, we demonstrated a causal effect between BMI and functional mobility (P = 0.001). Secondary gene enrichment evaluations highlighted down-regulation of genes at BMI risk loci that were correlated with poorer functional mobility in the substantia nigra and amygdala regions as compared to all other tissues. These genes also exhibit differential expression patterns during human brain development.

In Singapore, the journey to deliver quality healthcare amidst challenges posed by increasing prevalence of frailty with ageing populations is marked by three key epochal transitions: 1) Frailty-reality healthcare system; 2) Frailty-ready healthcare system; and 3) Frailty-resilient health system.\n\nThe multifaceted physical, cognitive, functional and psychosocial needs of frail older persons have rendered the conventional modus operandi of reactive, fragmented, facility-centric, doctor-based, and illness-centered care delivery as clearly unsustainable. In response, Singapore underwent a transformational journey underpinned by the Ministry of Health (MOH)\u2019s three beyonds: beyond healthcare to health, beyond hospital to community, and beyond quality to value. The aim was to forge a frailty-ready healthcare system across the frailty spectrum, ranging from the well healthy (\u201cliving well\u201d), well unhealthy (\u201cliving with illness\u201d), unwell unhealthy (\u201cliving with frailty\u201d), and end-of-life (\u201cdying well\u201d).
